# Simulation-of-Virtual-Memory-Paging-System

In this project, I:

• Designed a VM paging system including a TLB array, page table, and memory subsystems using MATLAB.

• Identified optimal system architecture by analysing cost and TLB hit rate across various simulation results.

• Used a least recently used write-back policy to implement write capability.

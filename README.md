# Simulation-of-Virtual-Memory-Paging-System

In this project, I:

• Designed a VM paging system including a TLB array, page table, and memory subsystems using MATLAB.

• Identified optimal system architecture by analysing cost and TLB hit rate across various simulation results.

• Used a least recently used write-back policy to implement write capability.

To run the program, open MATLAB and ensure that all the files are within the same directory. Then, just hit run and a simulation will report back with the analysis. 

There are 64k, 256k, and 1M variants but the file sizes were too big for GitHub. If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
